# Automated Bird Feeder Project

This project automates the feeding of my birds using an Arduino Uno, an RTC DS1307, an OLED display DS1306, 3 buttons, a servo motor, and PVC pipes. It ensures that my birds are fed even when I am not at home.

## Features

- **Automated Feeding:** The project uses three preset timings to feed the birds.
- **Configurable Timings:** Timings can be modified either by hardcoding or using the menu interface, which allows changes on the fly. Note that if the Arduino resets, the timings also reset.

## Components Used

- Arduino Uno
- RTC DS1307
- OLED Display DS1306
- 3 Buttons
- Servo Motor
- PVC Pipes
