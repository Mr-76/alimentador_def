YO mk1 was worse just a thing opening and closing like a car cilinder


mk 1.5 motor in the tube, and yes its a paper tube that paper...


mk2 pvc now supports were bad and posioning was bad too 


mk2.5 - better support but if not in a good position it would fall,arduino in bad position too..,1 bad thing - the seeds on the bottle would get stuck.


mk3 - better of all now it got a good support i can use a counter weight,fixed the bottle(bigger hole XD now the seeds wont get stuck),arduino in a better position now more organized, AND needed to add 2 pins to make the motor work in clock wise and counter clockwise because the motor would stop , the seed would stop it sooo i need to make in like that to try to evitate it to stop :) now its test time.
