## Little project that lets me control the amount of food given to my birds.


The little project,currently uses oen arduino uno, a rtc ds1307,a oled display ds1306,3 buttons a servo motor, and pvc pipes.

The project lets me automate the action of giving food to my birds,since sometimes im not a home, and i still need to give them food.

for now it uses 3 timings, to feed them, you can also modify the current timigns as ur needs on a hardcode way or using the little
menu that lets you change the timings of the little machine on the run(if the arduino resets so does the timaings).


## todo

- [ ] Set up any ammoutn of timings to be used
- [ ] Be able to modigy the amount of repetion of the feedng time.
- [ ] Probrably change the display.
- [ ] Build a somewhat of a pcb board
